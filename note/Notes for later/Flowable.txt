What is Business Process?
Business Process is a set of tasks that, once completed in a defined order, accomplishes a defined objective. 
Each task in a Business Process has clearly defined inputs and outputs. 
These tasks may require human intervention or may be completely automated.

OMG (Object Management Group) has defined a standard called Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) for businesses to define and communicate their processes.
The Flowable API fully supports creating and deploying BPMN 2.0 process definitions
