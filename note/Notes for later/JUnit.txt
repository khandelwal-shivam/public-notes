We need spring-boot-starter-test dependency to start with JUnit testing.
It is automatically added.


When we do testing on controller, it is called integration testing.

@Test annotation is used to write test methods.

We will use @SpringBootTest annotation when we need to bootstrap the entire container.

@Disable disables a test case

For assetion we use assertThat() method 

Ctrl+Shift+T is shortcut

WE might need to use @ExtendWith as well.
@Mock is annotation that is used when we want to use mock data.
